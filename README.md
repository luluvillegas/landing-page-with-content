Website based on The Odin Project Foundations Course designed to practice usage of HTML and CSS.

I initially coded a "template" website (that can be found in this link: https://github.com/luluvillegas/landing-page ) and now I am adding content to it. The idea is for the process of adding content to it to be easier based on the existing template.

Both projects should provide good practice to code using HTML and CSS. No functionality has been added to them yet.
